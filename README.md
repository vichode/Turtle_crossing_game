# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game  

A fun arcade-style game built with **Python’s Turtle Graphics** module!  
Your mission is simple — help the turtle cross the busy road without getting hit by cars.  
Each successful crossing increases your level and the car speed, making the game more challenging!

## 🎮 How to Play  
- Press the **Up Arrow key** to move your turtle forward.  
- Avoid getting hit by cars.  
- Reach the top of the screen to level up.  
- The game ends when a car collides with your turtle.
